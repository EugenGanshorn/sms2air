<h2>You're done!</h2>

<p>Congratulations, you have configured the App and you can now start to write SMS.</p>
<p>Please take a moment to notice the Apps features:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Define a custom sender address</strong><br/>You can specify a custom sender address for each SMS you send. In the preferences you can set a preferred sender address. You can override this setting at each SMS you send, just check it out.<br/>Please notice also that you can't choose a custom sender address if you are using the <strong>basic</strong> route.</li>
	<li><strong>Define a delay</strong></br>You can specify a time when the SMS should be sent. If you do so, the SMS will be sent to the server and from there it will be sent with the delay you specified. There is no need for you to be online at that time as the servers do that job for you.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Save your text as a draft</strong><br/>If you write a text and lose connection to the network, be calm. With the back key you can save your current version as a draft and send it later on.</li>
</ul>
